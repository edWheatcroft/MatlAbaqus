# MatlAbaqus
A collection of MATLAB scripts for interacting with ABAQUS. 
A lot of this code isn't written especially well/neatly. Tidying it up is an ongoing task...

Currently includes (see individual files for further information):
- readMSG() - A function to extract negative eigenvalue information from ABAQUS' .msg file.
- pyScripts - A directory containing a python package, abYthon, for interacting with ABAQUS' native python objects.

**This repository is currently under heavy development**

## Getting Started

- Either clone or download the repository.
- Add the repository's folder to the MATLAB path.
