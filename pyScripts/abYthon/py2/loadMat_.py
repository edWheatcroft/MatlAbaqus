def loadMat(filename):
    '''  
    This function should be called instead of direct spio.loadmat
    as it cures the problem of not properly recovering python dictionaries
    from mat files. It calls the function check keys to cure all entries
    which are still mat-objects.

    This issue has probably been fixed in the latest version of scipy, but 
    it's still an issue in ABAQUS' retro version.
    
    Matlab double arrays end up as lists. Just send them back to np.array()
    to fix this.
    Sililarly, strings and chars seem to end up as unicode, so send them
    back to str().
